# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
For this project, we used deep-learning neural networks and TensorFlow to classified the success of charitable donations. We processed the data, compiled, trained, and evaluated the model, and finally attempted to optimize the model.

## Results
### Attempt #1

## Summary

In *Attempt #1*, we used 2 hidden layers, with the first set to 80 neurons and the second set to 30. The accuracy score we achieved was **72.9446%.**

In *Attempt #2*, we used 3 hidden layers, with the first set to 100 neurons, the second set to 40, and the third set to 30. The accuracy score we achieved was **72.95627%.**

In *Attempt #3*, we used 4 hidden layers, with the first set to 80 neurons, the second set to 40, and the third set to 35, and the fourth set to 35. The accuracy score we achieved was **72.80467%.**

It appears that increasing the amount of hidden layers did have a positive effect on the accuracy score, as did adding more neurons in attempt #2. However, adding too many layers reduced our accuracy score in attempt #3.
